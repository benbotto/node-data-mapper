All the examples in this directory use the bike_shop database.  To import this
database, run the SQL in bike_shop.sql.  First log in to your MySQL server,
then run:

source bike_shop.sql

The database contains a series of bike shops.  Each bike shop has staff, and
staff can get bonuses.  Each bike shop sells bikes.  Two queries are run to
show what data have been added.  The first shows each bike shop, the staff for
each, and each staff members bonuses.  (Most staff members have not received
any bonuses.)  The second query shows each bike shop with all the bikes sold by
each shop.  (Note that some of the bikes are sold by multiple shops.)
