    node-data-mapper has a formal domain-specific language defined for WHERE
    and ON conditions.  The language is similar to MongoDB, and <span
    class="name">Condtions</span> are lexed, parsed, and compiled.
    Formally-defined <span class="name">Conditions</span> allow for securely
    filtering queries without worrying about SQL injection.  They also let
    developers create reusable queries that can be filtered dynamically,
    reducing query redundancy in code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at a quick example, and then look at the <span
    class="name">Condition</span> specification more closely.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
'use strict';

const MySQLDriver = require('node-data-mapper-mysql').MySQLDriver;
const driver      = new MySQLDriver(require('../bikeShopConOpts.json'));
const util        = require('util');

driver
  .initialize()
  .then(runQuery)
  .then(printResult)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => driver.end());

function runQuery(dataContext) {
  // Find all staff under the age of 22.
  const cond = {
    $lt: {
      'staff.age': ':age'
    }
  };

  const params = {
    age: 22
  };

  const query = dataContext
    .from('staff')
    .leftOuterJoin('staff.bonuses')
    .innerJoin('staff.bike_shops')
    .where(cond, params)
    .select()
    .orderBy('staff.age');

  console.log('Query:');
  console.log(query.toString(), '\n');

  return query
    .execute();
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log('Result:');
  console.log(util.inspect(result, {depth: null}));
}

  </pre>

  <p>
    Note that <span class="name">JOIN</span>ing has not yet been covered in
    these tutorials--that topic will be covered shortly.  At any rate, the
    above code snippet finds staff members that are younger than 22, and includes
    any bonuses that the staff member may have received, along with the bike
    shop that they work for.  Running this example (<span class="name">$ node
    example/retrieve/basicWhere.js</span>) logs the following output to the
    console.

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">

  <p>
    The <span class="name">WHERE</span> condition is compiled and parameterized
    as expected.  Next up, we'll look at how to make the query in the previous
    code dynamically filterable and orderable, and therefore reusable.
