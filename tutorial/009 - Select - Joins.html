    In the last example we examined a query that involved some <span
    class="name">JOIN</span>s using the {@link From#join} method.  This method
    will accept either a string argument or an object.  When a string is
    passed, an "implicit" join is performed when possible.  An implicit join is
    one such that node-data-mapper attempts to automatically derive the <span
    class="name">JOIN</span> predicate and relationship type.  This is only
    possible when there is <u>exactly one</u> relationship between the joined
    tables.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's examine one of the joins from the previous example more closely, and
    then look at explicit joins.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
dataContext
  .from('staff s')
  .leftOuterJoin('s.bonuses b');
  </pre>

  <p>
    First, we select from the <span class="name">staff</span> table, giving it
    an alias of <span class="name">s</span>.  Then, a {@link
    From#leftOuterJoin} is performed on the <span class="name">bonuses</span>
    table.  When a string is supplied as an argument (e.g. "<span
    class="name">s.bonuses b</span>") it must follow the format specified by
    the {@link From#parseJoinString} method, which is shown here for
    convenience.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source">[&lt;parent-table-alias&gt;.]&lt;table-name&gt;[ [as ]&lt;table-alias&gt;]</pre>

  <p>
    As mentioned above, however, implicit joins are not always possible (nor
    desirable).  It's therefore possible to pass the {@link From#join} method a
    {@link TableMetaList~TableMeta} object instead of a string.  In the code
    snippet above, the string passed to the {@link From#parseJoinString} method
    (i.e. "<span class="name">s.bonuses b</span>") will be parsed and converted
    to a {@link TableMetaList~TableMeta} object.  The above "implicit" join is
    equivalent to this "explicit" one.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
dataContext
  .from('staff s')
  .leftOuterJoin({
    parent:  's',
    table:   'bonuses',
    as:      'b',
    relType: 'many',
    on:      {$eq: {'s.staffID': 'b.staffID'}}
  });
  </pre>

  <p>
    Let's take a closer look at each property.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The <span class="name">parent</span> of the <span
      class="name">bonuses</span> table is set to <span class="name">s</span>,
      which is the alias for the <span class="name">staff</span> table.  When
      the query result is serialized to a normalized JavaScript object, an
      array of <span class="name">bonuses</span> will be nested under each
      staff member (<span class="name">bonuses</span> is a child of <span
      class="name">staff</span>).
    </li>

    <li>
      The joined-in <span class="name">table</span> is <span
      class="name">bonuses</span>, with an alias of <span
      class="name">b</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="name">relType</span>--which is an abbreviation for
      relationship type--is set to "<span class="name">many</span>", because
      each staff member can have many bonuses.
    </li>

    <li>
      The tables are joined together using the <span
      class="name">staffID</span> column.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's worth pointing out that the <span class="name">relType</span> property
    can be set to "<span class="name">many</span>" or "<span
    class="name">single</span>."  As can be seen in the example below, when
    joining from <span class="name">bonuses</span> to <span
    class="name">staff</span>, the <span class="name">relType</span> property
    should be set to "<span class="name">single</span>."  This is because each
    <span class="name">bonus</span> record is tied to exactly one <span
    class="name">staff</span> record, so it's preferable to have <span
    class="name">bonuses</span> serialized to an object rather than an array.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also worth mentioning: The <span class="name">on</span> property takes a
    <span class="name">Condition</span> object, and any valid <span
    class="name">Condition</span> object can be provided as a join predicate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a more complex join example, using an explicit join from bonuses to
    staff.

'use strict';

const MySQLDriver = require('node-data-mapper-mysql').MySQLDriver;
const driver      = new MySQLDriver(require('../bikeShopConOpts.json'));
const util        = require('util');

driver
  .initialize()
  .then(runQuery)
  .then(printResult)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => driver.end());

function runQuery(dataContext) {
  // Get all the bonuses in the system, with the single staff member for each
  // bonus, but only for staff members over the age of 21.
  const query = dataContext
    .from('bonuses b')
    .innerJoin(
      {
        parent:  'b',
        table:   'staff',
        as:      's',
        relType: 'single',
        on: {
          $and: [
            {$eq:  {'s.staffID': 'b.staffID'}},
            {$gte: {'s.age': ':minAge'}}
          ]
        }
      },
      {minAge: 22}
    )
    .select(
      's.staffID', 's.lastName', 's.age',
      'b.bonusID', 'b.amount'
    );

  console.log('Query:');
  console.log(query.toString(), '\n');

  return query
    .execute();
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log('Result:');
  console.log(util.inspect(result, {depth: null}));
}
