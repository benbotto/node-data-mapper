    The previous examples covered deleting models by ID, which reflects a
    common use case.  But sometimes a more complex delete is needed, for
    example using a <span class="name">WHERE</span> clause or <span
    class="name">JOIN</span>s.  Recall that back in the 
    <a href="tutorial-002 - Select - Select all from a Single Table.html">
    Select all from a Single Table</a> tutorial it was mentioned that the
    {@link DataContext#from} method returns a {@link FromAdapter} instance, and
    that a {@link FromAdapter} can be used for deleting and updating as well as
    selecting.  Let's revisit this and see how to perform complex deletes.

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
'use strict';

const MySQLDriver = require('node-data-mapper-mysql').MySQLDriver;
const driver      = new MySQLDriver(require('../bikeShopConOpts.json'));

driver
  .initialize()
  .then(runQuery)
  .then(printResult)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => driver.end());

function runQuery(dataContext) {
  const query = dataContext
    .from('staff s')
    .leftOuterJoin('s.bonuses b')
    .where(
      // Staff members that have never received a bonus and are over the age
      // of 65 are getting fired today.
      {
        $and: [
          {$is: {'b.bonusID': null}},
          {$gt: {'s.age': ':overTheHill'}}
        ]
      },
      {overTheHill: 65}
    )
    .delete();

  console.log('Query:');
  console.log(query.toString(), '\n');

  return query
    .execute();
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log('Result:');
  console.log(result);
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    In the above example, <span class="name">staff</span> and <span
    class="name">bonuses</span> are joined together.  Then the query is
    filtered such that only staff members that have never received a bonus and
    are over the age of 65 are included.  These staff members are deleted.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's worth pointing out that the {@link FromAdapter#delete} method takes an
    optional <span class="name">tableAlias</span> parameter.  If not supplied,
    then the root table's alias is deleted from (<span class="name">s</span>,
    the alias of <span class="name">staff</span>, in this case).  But, like raw
    SQL, one can join in a table and then delete from it (e.g. <span
    class="name">delete('b')</span> would instead delete bonus records).
  </p>

  <p>
    The example shown above prints the following output when run (<span
    class="name">$ node example/delete/complexDelete.js</span>):
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
Query:
DELETE  `s`
FROM    `staff` AS `s`
LEFT OUTER JOIN `bonuses` AS `b` ON `s`.`staffID` = `b`.`staffID`
WHERE   (`b`.`bonusID` IS NULL AND `s`.`age` > :overTheHill) 

Result:
{ affectedRows: 1 }
