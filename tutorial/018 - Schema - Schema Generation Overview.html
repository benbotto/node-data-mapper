    One of the key features of node-data-mapper is that models do not need to
    be explicitly defined.  Most ORMs--Sequelize, Mongoose, TypeORM,
    etc.--require the user to first define models.  (By no means is this
    intended as a bash of these excellent pieces of software.) node-data-mapper
    takes a different approach, however, and uses the database itself to
    determine what can be retrieved and persisted from and to the database.
    This has some advantages.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Easy startup.  Developers don't need to invest time defining models prior
      to using node-data-mapper.
    </li>

    <li>
      Database-first design.  Most ORMs require the user to create models, and
      then the database schema is created based on those models.  Model-first
      design doesn't always play well with existing databases.
    </li>

    <li>
      Control.  With node-data-mapper the developer creates the database how he
      or she sees fit, and then the ORM reads and utilizes the existing
      database schema.  This gives full control of the database to the
      developer.
    </li>

    <li>
      Terse.  node-data-mapper can be dropped into existing projects with an
      existing database, and doesn't require (or even promote) abandoning
      existing data access.  It can be used in new code, while existing code
      utilizes raw SQL, or even alongside another ORM.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you've been following the tutorials, you have probably noticed that each
    example begins by initializing a database driver.  The initialization
    process queries the database's metadata (generally using the <span
    class="name">INFORMATION_SCHEMA</span> database) and generates a schema
    object.  This schema object is then used to construct a {@link Database}
    instance, which is composed of a series of {@link Table} and {@link Column}
    instances.  Let's take a look at what a schema object looks like, and then
    discuss customizations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following example simply initializes node-data-mapper, and then dumps
    the resulting {@link Database} instance (a.k.a. "schema object").
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
'use strict';

const MySQLDriver = require('node-data-mapper-mysql').MySQLDriver;
const driver      = new MySQLDriver(require('../bikeShopConOpts.json'));

driver
  .initialize()
  .then(dumpSchema)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => driver.end());

function dumpSchema(dataContext) {
  console.log('Schema:');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(dataContext.database, null, 2));
}

function printResult(result) {
  console.log('Result:');
  console.log(result);
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    The example can be run by issuing this command: <span class="name">node
    example/schema/generation.js</span>.  The output below is trimmed for
    brevity, and annotated.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
{
  // The database name.
  "name": "bike_shop",

  // A Database instance has an array of tables.
  "tables": [
    {
      // The "bikes" table.
      "name": "bikes",

      // When retrieving, table names can be mapped to different properties.
      // This is useful if your table naming convention differs from your
      // JavaScript naming convention.  More on this in the next tutorial.
      "mapTo": "bikes",

      // Each Table instance has an array of Columns, and each Column instance
      // holds metadata.
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "bikeID",

          // See the note above about mappings.
          "mapTo": "bikeID",
          "dataType": "int",
          "columnType": "int(11)",
          "isNullable": false,
          "maxLength": null,
          "isPrimary": true,
          "defaultValue": null,

          // A Column can have a Converter object attached, which allows data to
          // be converted when it is retrieved or persisted.  For example, a
          // developer could strip special characters from phone numbers when
          // saved, and then format phone numbers when retrieved.
          "converter": {}
        },

        // Snip...
      ]
    },

    // Snip...
  ]
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    It may be worth inspecting the schema object further, as it contains other
    metadata like foreign key information.  In the next examples, however,
    we'll focus on customizing tables and columns.
