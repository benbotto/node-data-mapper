    The simplest query one can perform is selecting all data from a single
    table.

  <pre class="prettyprint source linenums">
'use strict';

const MySQLDriver = require('node-data-mapper-mysql').MySQLDriver;
const driver      = new MySQLDriver(require('../bikeShopConOpts.json'));

// 1) Initialize node-data-mapper.
// 2) Retrieve all the records from the bike_shops table.
// 3) Print the results on the console.
// 4) Close the DB connection.

    .select();

  // This is the query that will be executed.
  console.log('Query:');

    Running this code (<span class="name">$ node example/retrieve/allFromSingleTable.js</span>)
    yields the following output.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source">
Query:
SELECT  `bike_shops`.`address` AS `bike_shops.address`,
        `bike_shops`.`bikeShopID` AS `bike_shops.bikeShopID`,
        `bike_shops`.`name` AS `bike_shops.name`
FROM    `bike_shops` AS `bike_shops` 

Result:
{ bike_shops: 
   [ { bikeShopID: 1,
       address: '9107 Sunrise Blvd',
       name: 'Bob\'s Bikes' },
     { bikeShopID: 2,
       address: '18271 Highway 50',
       name: 'Zephyr Cove Cruisers' },
     { bikeShopID: 3,
       address: '3100 La Riviera Wy',
       name: 'Cycle Works' } ] }

  <p>
    In the above example, {@link DataContext#from} is called, which returns a
    {@link FromAdapter} instance.  The notion of a {@link From} is central to
    node-data-mapper, and a {@link FromAdapter} instance can be used for
    selecting, updating, and deleting.  This should be fairly intuitive: When
    using raw SQL a user can <span class="name">SELECT...FROM</span>, <span
    class="name">UPDATE...FROM</span>, and <span
    class="name">DELETE...FROM</span>.  One of the goals of node-data-mapper is
    to provide an interface that closely resembles SQL, and since <span
    class="name">FROM</span> so often occurs in queries, {@link
    DataContext#from} is often the starting point when querying with
    node-data-mapper.
