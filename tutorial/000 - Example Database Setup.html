  <p>
    The examples provided in these tutorials use a fictitious <i
    class="name">bike_shop</i> database.  If you would like to run the example
    code, which is contained in the <i class="name">example</i> directory,
    then you'll need to create the <i class="name">bike_shop</i> database in a
    local MySQL database.  The <i class="name">example/bike_shop.sql</i>
    script can be used to create this database by logging in to your MySQL
    server and running:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint source">source example/bike_shop.sql</pre>

  <p>
    The database contains a series of bike shops.  Each bike shop has staff,
    and staff can get bonuses.  Each bike shop sells bikes.  When you source <i
    class="name">bike_shop.sql</i>, two queries are run to show what data have
    been added.  The first shows all the bike shops, the staff for each, and
    each staff member's bonuses.  (Most staff members have not received any
    bonuses.)  The second query shows all the bike shops with all the bikes
    sold by each shop.  Note that some of the bikes are sold by multiple shops.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <i class="name">bike_shop.sql</i> script creates a user "example" with
    a password of "secret."  If you change the credentials then you will need
    to update the <i class="name">bikeShopConOpts.json</i> file accordingly.
